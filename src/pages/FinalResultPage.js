          Larger scale upcycling projects may span longer time framesâ€”from weeks
          to months. Our team did not manage to explore more complex projects as
          we did not have the luxury of time to conduct extensive research and
          follow our users through the stages of a large-scale upcycling
          project. If we had more time to conduct user research, we would like
          to observe upcycling projects that are more complex, as it may affect
          the level of customisation and guidance (of the instructions) in our
          designed workflow.

          Our team would also like to develop a decision tree for Sew Auntyâ€™s
          voice interaction, as we did not have sufficient time to research and
          design a no-UI wireframe for the voice interface. We need to weigh in
          careful consideration to provide the optimum hands-off experience for
          our users.
